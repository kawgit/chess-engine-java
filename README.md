# chess-engine-java
A chess engine project coded in java from scratch by me. Idk what I'm doing, just learning as I go. This is unfinished version:
TODO:
-IMPORTANT add pawn promotion, currently only promotes to queen
-IMPORTANT add aimode 2, currently computer can only play as white

-other ideas:
  -attach captures only search to end of search
  -keep track of where pieces are, so that it doesnt need to loop through every square to check for valid moves
  -add eval of piece position to eval (including pawn structure)

























 -destroy chess club
